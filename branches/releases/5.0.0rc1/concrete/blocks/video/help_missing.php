	<p>The file block allows you to add individual files to your website. You may specify the type of file including PDF, Word Doc, and Flash SWFs. The site will know what to do with the unique file types, for example: allowing users to download a PDF vs. displaying a SWF in the page. </p>
	<p>	
	<strong>File</strong><br/>
	This field allows you to specify the file you want to upload to your website. 
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Document Type</strong><br/>
	The document type selector allows you to choose the type of file you're uploading. While the default selection will simply create a link to the file in the page (using the 'Link Text' attribute below), other options may effect presentation. For example, when selecting SWF (a Flash file), you may specify width and height of the particular file, as it is required by Flash to generate. The SWF file will then be displayed inline in your page.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Link Text</strong><br/>
	 When uploading a generic file, this is the label that will appear in the page.
