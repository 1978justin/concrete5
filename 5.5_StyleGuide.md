# 5.5. Style Guide

## Before You Start

* Become familiar with the table styling, form styling, type styling and grid sections from Twitter Bootstrap: 
	http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

## Most Important

* Any time you want to use the styles found in Twitter Bootstrap, you have to ensure that a div with the class "ccm-ui" wraps around whatever you want to style. This happens automatically when using the 
getDashboardPaneHeaderWrapper() and getDashboardPaneFooterWrapper() functions below, but otherwise make sure that your dialogs and single pages contain this.

## Markup

* Generally, don't use tables to position form elements. Use the bootstrap form layouts, and grids.
* Tables are fine for tabular data. Feel free to get sassy with the "zebra-striped" class on a table.

## Dashboard Panes

Any time you need to open the primary dialog on a page, use this function:
	
	<?
	$h = Loader::helper('concrete/dashboard');
	print $h->getDashboardPaneHeaderWrapper($title, $helpText, $columnSpanClass, $includeDefaultBody);
	?>
	
	By default, $columnSpanClass and $includeDefaultBody can be left blank. If $columnSpanClass is blank, the dialog will span the 960 width. If includeDefaultBody is left blank, the default body (which does NOT include a button footer but does include the body) will be used.
	
	An example of not including the default body and making a slightly smaller dialog can be found on the sitemap page:
	
	print $h->getDashboardPaneHeaderWrapper(t('Sitemap'), t('The sitemap allows you to view your site as a tree and easily organize its hierarchy.'), 'span14 offset1', false);

	If you don't include a default body, you need to add <div class="ccm-pane-body"> immediately below your content. Then, when you want to add a footer, you need to add <div class="ccm-pane-footer"></div> after that.
	
To close a primary dialog, either include:

	print $h->getDashboardPaneFooterWrapper();
	
	or print $h->getDashboardPaneFooterWrapper(false);
	
	You need to use "false" if you used "false" for $includeDefaultBody above.
	
Dashboard panes ought to use the ccm-pane-footer class with any buttons that are in them. For examples of this, try setting up a page type for composer and writing a draft, or adding a file set.

Examples of Dashboard Panes
* Pane with buttons: Dashboard > System & Settings > Editing > Languages
* Add File Set (also has an example of a search bar)
	
## Button Treatments

* All links or buttons should have a "btn" class. Most of the time when using the buttons found in Loader::helper('concrete/interface') this should already be applied.
* Dashboard panes ought to use "btn error" for the class on any delete buttons (this will make them red)
* Dashboard panes ought to use "btn primary" for any update/add buttons.
