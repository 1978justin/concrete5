	<p>This is the inline help for blocks themselves (like the summary block, the auto-nav block, images, etc…) There is currently no specific Concrete help for the text rich editor, because all of that’s controlled by the JavaScript widget itself.</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Image File</strong><br/>
	This field allows you to place an image from your computer onto the website. Just click the 'browse' button, locate the image file on your hard drive, and hit OK.</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Image File On-State</strong><br/>
	When the image block needs two images for the same spot, (like for an animation that changes when the visitor’s mouse rolls over the image or a navigation that looks different depending on where you are in the site), click ‘browse’ here to upload a second, alternative image for this block.</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Image Linking Properties</strong>
	<ol>
		<li>No Link.<br/>This is the default. The image does not link to anywhere.</li>
		<li>Link to a Page on the Site.<br/>If you select this option, you must also click the 'search' button to find a target location. Once you've located the page in the search window, click the 'select' link next to the listing.</li>
		<li>Off-site Link<br/>Simply enter any URL (for example http://yahoo.com) and the image will link to it.</li>
	</ol>
